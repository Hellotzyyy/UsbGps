UsbGps4Droid is a USB GPS provider application for the Android operating system, providing GPS support for devices running Android 4.0 and above

The application provides location updates to Android which allows devices without an internal GPS to still use applications which require GPS (Google Maps navigation).

I use this USB Gps with my Android Tablet Headunit, because the internal GPS does not work reliably. I have a main controller which automatically starts this application's background service when my car starts

The application is designed to work with any SiRF USB GPS device, however it has been tested as working with GlobalSat BU-353-S4 and a device based on the UBLOX LEA-M8P chip.
